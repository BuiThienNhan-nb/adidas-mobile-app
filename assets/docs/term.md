**21. WEB SITE DISPUTE RESOLUTION – ARBITRATION, JURY TRIAL WAIVER, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER**
Neither you nor we will be able to sue in court in connection with a Web Site Dispute. All Web Site Disputes must be resolved through individual (non-class) arbitration. You indicate your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions, including this agreement to arbitrate, by continuing to use the Site after having the opportunity to review these Terms and Conditions.
You and adidas intend for this to be an agreement for arbitration that can be enforced under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C.A. §§ 1–16.
You and adidas waive any rights to maintain other available resolution processes for Web Site Disputes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle disputes. You and adidas waive any right to a jury trial for Web Site Disputes.
Instead of suing in court, we each agree to settle Web Site Disputes only by arbitration. The rules in arbitration are different. There’s no judge or jury, and review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief and must honor the same limitations stated in the agreement as a court would.
Any Web Site Dispute shall be determined by arbitration in Oregon before one arbitrator(s). The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. If for any reason, JAMS cannot or will not provide this arbitration, the parties may ask any court of competent jurisdiction to select an arbitrator from a list provided by the parties.
To the extent, a party commences any action which includes both Web Site Disputes and Non-Web Site Disputes, consideration of the Non-Web Site Disputes shall be stayed until the Web Site Disputes are fully arbitrated. Then, any Non-Web Site Disputes will be considered by any court of competent jurisdiction.
You agree that you will not file a class action against adidas and its affiliated companies, or participate in a class action against adidas and its affiliated companies, in any Web Site Dispute. You agree that you will not file or seek a class arbitration or participate in a class arbitration against adidas and its affiliated companies, in any Web Site Dispute.

**22. GENERAL**
Any claim relating to, and the use of, this Site and the materials contained herein is governed by the laws of the State of Oregon, U.S.A. You consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Multnomah County, Oregon. A printed version of these Terms will be admissible in judicial and administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
Except as prohibited by applicable New Jersey law, we do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted, or secure access to our Web Site or Services, and the operation of the Web Site may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control.
If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced.
You agree that the Agreement may be automatically assigned by adidas in our sole discretion. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. Sections 9 (User Generated Content – Your License to Us); 11 (Access and Interference), 15 (Limitation of Liability), 16 (Legal Notice to New Jersey Residents), 17 (Indemnity), and 18 (Release) shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

**24. HYPE SALES**
These hype terms and conditions (“Hype Terms”) govern your participation in adidas online hype sales (“Hype Sale”). Please read them carefully before participating. By participating in a Hype Sale, you agree to be bound by these Hype Terms and the decisions of adidas. These Hype Terms apply in addition to the other terms and conditions that apply to your use of www.adidas.com (“Web Site”) and the adidas mobile application (the “App,” and together with the Web Site, the “Platform”).  If there is a conflict between the general terms and conditions for the Platform and these Hype Terms, then these Hype Terms will control.



**24.1 INTRODUCTION**

The Hype Sale is an opportunity for customers to purchase a limited edition adidas product (“Hype Product”) through the Platform or solely through the App.



**24.2 ELIGIBILITY**

The Hype Sale is open only to legal residents of the 50 United States (including the District of Columbia) who are at least 13 years old at the time of participation.

**24.3 SALE PERIOD**

The Hype Sale begins and ends on the period described in the Platform (the “Sale Period”).

**24.4 HOW TO PARTICIPATE**

In order to participate through the App, you must have a mobile phone that uses the iOS or Android operating system and has the ability to receive text messages. You also must have location services and in-app messaging enabled on your mobile phone. If you are under 18 or otherwise under the legal age of majority in the jurisdiction in which the entrant resides (a “Minor”), you must obtain your parent’s or legal guardian’s permission to participate, and they must agree to these Hype Terms prior to your participation. To participate, create an adidas account. Once you have an account, during the Sale Period, you must enter the requested information to complete your participation

**24.5 PARTICIPATION RULES**

There may be a limit of one Hype Product per person during the Sale Period. This will be communicated to you through the Platform.  All entries must be submitted and received before the conclusion of the Sales Period. Normal time rates and data charges, if any, charged by your internet or mobile service provider will apply. All entries are subject to verification at any time. Proof of submission does not constitute proof of entry.

**24.6 SELECTION OF PURCHASERS**

After the end of the Sales Period, participants will be selected at random or on a first come first served basis, to purchase the Hype Product (“Purchaser”). If participants are selected at random, then some advantage is given to higher-tier Creator Club members.  Being a Creator Club member, even in the higher tiers, does not guarantee that you will be selected to be a Purchaser.  You will be notified of the selection method through the Platform. 

**24.7 PRODUCT PURCHASE AND DELIVERY**

If we select participants at random, and if you are selected as a Purchaser, we will notify you by e-mail (sent to the e-mail address provided when entering), and automatically charge the purchase price of the Hype Product, plus any applicable taxes, and shipping and handling, to the payment method you provided to participate in the Hype Sale. We will ship the Hype Product to the shipping address you provided to participate in the Hype Sale. adidas’ standard payment and shipping terms apply.  If we select Purchasers on a first come first served basis, you should complete the checkout of the Hype Products in your shopping list as fast as you can after the Hype Products have been released for purchase, to increase the chance of purchasing them. We do not guarantee you can purchase any of the Hype Products that are in your shopping list either prior to or after the release of the Hype Products. We will notify you of the exact time of release through a timer on the Platform and by e-mail (sent to the e-mail address provided when entering).

**24.8 PRODUCT AVAILABILITY**

We are offering a limited number of Hype Products for purchase through the Hype Sale. This offer is good while supplies last and may be limited to one Hype Product per participant and account during the Hype Sale. Purchasers may return Hype Products, subject to adidas’ returns policy, which is available on our website.

**24.9 GENERAL RULES**

adidas reserves the right to modify these Hype Terms, and to cancel, modify, or suspend the Hype Sale at any time. adidas has the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify or prohibit from participating in the Hype Sale any individual who adidas believes (i) has tampered with the entry process or undermined the legitimate operation of the Hype Sale in any manner; (ii) has engaged in conduct that annoys, abuses, threatens, or harasses any other participant or any representative of adidas; or (iii) has attempted or intends to attempt any of the foregoing. The use of agents or automated devices, programs, or methods to submit entries is prohibited, and adidas has the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify any participant that it believes may have been submitted an entry using such an agent or automated device, program, or method.

**24.12 TAXES**

If we select participants at random, we may not always be able to compute the exact amount of tax at the time you enter the Hype Sale.  In these situations, taxes that appear when you enter the Hype Sale may be estimated. The actual taxes charged to your payment method will be calculated based on the applicable state and local tax rates if and when you are selected to purchase the Hype Product and will be reflected on the receipt emailed to you at that time.

**25. ENTIRE AGREEMENT**
The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the user and adidas and supersedes any prior understandings or agreements (written or oral). If you do not understand any of the foregoing Terms or if you have any questions or comments, we invite you to contact our Customer Service Department by email at customerservice@shopadidas.com or by phone at 1-800-982-9337.
